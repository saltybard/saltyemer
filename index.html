    <div>Semi-flocking behavior sim.  Original intention was the idea that if the leader(blue) had a guard detail then it wouldn't get caught as easily</div>
    <div>However, it turns out that instead of keeping it from getting caught, the mob of helpers gets the leader stuck in bad spots</div>
    <div>So that it wouldn't end as quickly, the predator circle has to stop to eat the circle that it caught, allowing the leader </div>
    <div>and its followers time to escape without having cascading failure.</div>
